## Executive Summary

MeshBeacon is a low-cost, field-deployable search and rescue system that uses LoRaWAN mesh networks to detect survivors via their Bluetooth medical devices and personal electronics. By combining the btrpa-scan BLE detection technology with inexpensive Heltec LoRa nodes (~$18 each), emergency responders can rapidly deploy a wide-area detection grid capable of locating people with pacemakers, insulin pumps, fitness trackers, and smartphones in disaster zones, collapsed structures, and wilderness areas.

**Core Innovation:** Transform medical device Bluetooth identifiers from privacy concerns into lifesaving beacons during emergencies.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Search and Rescue Challenges

In disaster scenarios—earthquakes, building collapses, avalanches, floods, wildfires—locating survivors quickly is critical but difficult:

- **Debris and Rubble:** Traditional visual and acoustic searches fail when victims are buried
- **Time Sensitivity:** Survival rates drop dramatically after 72 hours (the "golden window")
- **Large Search Areas:** Wilderness and disaster zones can span hundreds of square kilometers
- **Resource Constraints:** SAR teams are limited by personnel, equipment, and communication infrastructure
- **Infrastructure Collapse:** Cellular towers, Wi-Fi, and power grids fail in disasters

### The Bluetooth Opportunity

Nearly every person today carries or wears Bluetooth devices:
- **Medical Devices:** Pacemakers, insulin pumps, CGMs, hearing aids (always transmitting for telemetry)
- **Wearables:** Fitness trackers, smartwatches (frequent BLE advertisements)
- **Smartphones:** Constant BLE beacon scanning for devices/services
- **Wireless Earbuds:** Persistent BLE advertising when active

These devices create a unique Bluetooth "signature" that can be detected at range (10-100+ meters depending on conditions) even when victims are:
- Unconscious or unable to call for help
- Trapped under debris where voice/visual search fails
- In remote wilderness areas
- Without functioning cellular service

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Technology | Limitation |
|------------|------------|
| **Cellular Triangulation** | Requires functioning towers; dies within hours of disaster |
| **Thermal Imaging** | Expensive equipment; limited by debris/water; only detects body heat |
| **Search Dogs** | Amazing but limited by handler fatigue, weather, scent contamination |
| **Voice/Acoustic** | Requires conscious victim; fails under heavy debris |
| **Drones** | Short flight time; visual only; struggles in smoke/darkness/heavy foliage |

---

## Solution Overview

### System Architecture

MeshBeacon consists of three components:

**1. Detection Nodes (Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4)**
- Scan for BLE devices (medical devices, phones, wearables)
- GPS-tag detections with precise coordinates
- Transmit findings via LoRaWAN mesh to coordinator
- Solar-powered for extended deployment (optional)
- Weatherproof enclosure for field conditions

**2. LoRaWAN Mesh Network**
- Long-range radio communication (10-15km line-of-sight, 2-5km urban)
- Self-healing mesh topology (nodes relay messages automatically)
- Low power consumption (days/weeks on battery)
- Operates without cellular/internet infrastructure
- Meshtastic-compatible for community SAR networks

**3. Command Center Application**
- Real-time map of all BLE detections
- Prioritized victim list (medical devices = highest priority)
- Signal strength heatmaps for triangulation
- Integration with existing SAR coordination tools
- Export to KML/GPX for field teams

### How It Works

```
[Victim with Pacemaker]
        ↓ BLE Advertisement (70:B3:D5:B3:4:XX:X)
[Detection Node A] ← 15m away, RSSI -65dBm
        ↓ LoRa transmission
[Detection Node B] ← Mesh relay
        ↓
[Detection Node C] ← Mesh relay
        ↓
[Command Center] ← "Medical device detected at GPS 34.0522°N, 118.2437°W"
        ↓
[SAR Team Dispatch] → Prioritize rescue at that location
```

**Key Advantage:** Multiple nodes detecting the same device enable triangulation for sub-10-meter accuracy.

## Technical Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge 1: Bluetooth Range Limitations

**Problem:** BLE typically ranges 10-30m; detection range inadequate for large search areas

**Mitigations:**
- **High-gain antennas:** Upgrade from PCB antenna to external 2.4GHz whip (+3-5dB gain)
- **Active scanning:** Use SCAN_REQ to elicit SCAN_RSP from devices (increases effective range)
- **Multiple nodes:** Dense deployment (50m spacing) ensures overlapping coverage
- **Elevated placement:** Height advantage improves line-of-sight (inverse square law)
- **Directionality:** Use directional antennas on mobile nodes for "sweep" searching

**Expected Improvement:** Range 30m → 60-100m in optimal conditions

### Challenge 2: Bluetooth Privacy - Random MAC Addresses

**Problem:** Modern smartphones randomize MAC addresses (Apple iOS 14+, Android 10+) to prevent tracking

**Mitigations:**
- **IRK resolution:** Extract Identity Resolving Keys from smartphone backups (requires victim consent/pre-registration)
- **Fingerprinting:** Even with random MACs, service UUIDs and manufacturer data remain constant
- **Behavioral patterns:** Detect "clusters" of devices that move together (likely single person)
- **Medical devices:** Many medical devices do NOT use random MACs (legacy Bluetooth implementations)

**Effectiveness:** Can still detect 60-80% of smartphones via non-randomized fields; medical devices remain 100% detectable

### Challenge 3: RF Interference in Urban Environments

**Problem:** Urban areas saturated with Bluetooth devices (cars, appliances, other survivors' phones)

**Mitigations:**
- **Medical device prioritization:** Flag known medical MAC prefixes immediately (no false positives)
- **RSSI filtering:** Ignore weak signals (<-85dBm) to focus on nearby devices
- **Time-series analysis:** Track signal strength over time (trapped victim's signal should be static, not moving)
- **Duplicate suppression:** Mesh network deduplicates same MAC from multiple nodes

**Expected Result:** ~10% false positive rate in dense urban; <1% for medical devices

### Challenge 4: LoRa Mesh Scalability

**Problem:** LoRa has limited bandwidth (~250 bps); mesh network may saturate with 50+ nodes

**Mitigations:**
- **Message prioritization:** Medical device detections sent immediately; other devices batched
- **Adaptive duty cycle:** Nodes reduce transmission rate if channel busy (CSMA/CA)
- **Edge processing:** Nodes filter and aggregate detections before transmission (send summaries, not raw scans)
- **Multi-channel:** Use multiple LoRa frequencies (if hardware supports) for parallel communication

**Capacity:** Estimated 50 nodes maximum per mesh with 5-minute latency; 100 nodes with 15-minute latency

### Challenge 5: Power Management for Extended Deployments

**Problem:** Battery-only nodes last 24-48 hours; long disasters (hurricanes, wildfires) require weeks

**Mitigations:**
- **Solar panels:** 5W panel + 10,000mAh battery = indefinite operation in sunny conditions
- **Conservation mode:** Reduce scan rate from 100% to 10% duty cycle (extends life 10x)
- **Hierarchical mesh:** Battery-powered mobile nodes, solar-powered fixed nodes (fixed nodes relay)
- **Swappable batteries:** Quick-change battery packs for field replacement

**Target:** 7+ days on battery; indefinite with solar (at reduced scan rate)

---

## Ethics, Privacy, and Legal Considerations

### Informed Consent

**Question:** Is it ethical to detect medical devices without patient consent?

**Position:** 
- **Emergency Exception:** In life-threatening emergencies, detection without consent is justified (similar to medical triage)
- **Opt-In Program:** For pre-planned deployments (hurricanes, wildfires), offer opt-in device registration program
- **Data Deletion:** All MAC addresses purged within 30 days post-incident; no long-term storage

**Best Practice:** Partner with medical device manufacturers to add "emergency beacon mode" toggle in device apps

### Medical Device Safety

**Question:** Could RF emissions from LoRa nodes interfere with medical devices?

**Position:**
- **Passive BLE scanning only:** Nodes do not transmit on 2.4GHz (no interference with medical devices)
- **LoRa frequency:** 900MHz (US) / 868MHz (EU) - separate from medical device telemetry (2.4GHz)
- **Low power:** 28dBm LoRa TX power well below FCC limits; medical devices tested for EM immunity

**Validation Required:** Test with actual pacemakers/insulin pumps in lab environment before field deployment

### HIPAA Compliance (US) / GDPR (EU)

**Question:** Does detecting MAC addresses constitute collection of protected health information?

**Legal Analysis:**
- **HIPAA:** MAC address alone is NOT PHI (not individually identifiable); becomes PHI only when linked to name/identity
- **GDPR:** MAC address is "personal data"; emergency processing permitted under Article 6(1)(d) (vital interests)
- **Data Minimization:** Collect only MAC, RSSI, GPS; do NOT collect device serial numbers, patient names, or medical data

**Compliance Strategy:**
- No linkage of MAC addresses to patient identities during operations
- Emergency use exemption documentation
- Data retention policy: 30 days maximum
- Incident commander is data controller; SAR organization responsible

### Law Enforcement Concerns

**Question:** Could this technology be misused for surveillance/tracking?

**Mitigation:**
- **Open Source:** All code public on GitHub; community audit for backdoors/tracking features
- **Emergency-Only Design:** System requires manual deployment and activation (not covert)
- **Short-Range Detection:** 50-100m range prevents wide-area surveillance
- **Encryption:** LoRa mesh messages encrypted (prevents third-party eavesdropping)

**Policy Position:** MeshBeacon is SAR-only technology; use for law enforcement surveillance violates project ethics and should be prohibited by license terms

## Open Questions

### Technical

1. **IRK Extraction:** Can we develop legal, ethical method to extract IRK from smartphones for pre-registration programs?
   - **Approach:** Work with phone manufacturers (Apple, Google) on "Emergency Beacon" API
   - **Timeline:** 2027-2028 (requires industry partnerships)

2. **Medical Device Database:** Who maintains the authoritative list of medical device MAC prefixes?
   - **Proposed Solution:** Crowdsourced GitHub repository; contributions from SAR teams, medical device users
   - **Validation:** Cross-reference with FDA device listings, manufacturer docs

3. **Mesh Protocol:** Should we use Meshtastic (established, large community) or custom protocol (optimized for SAR)?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with Meshtastic for Phase 1-2; evaluate custom protocol in Phase 3 if performance insufficient

### Operational

4. **Certification:** Do SAR teams need special training/certification to deploy MeshBeacon?
   - **Recommendation:** 2-hour training module; no formal certification required (similar to thermal imaging cameras)

5. **Liability:** Who is liable if system fails to detect victim or provides false location?
   - **Legal Consultation Required:** Likely covered under Good Samaritan laws; need formal legal opinion
   - **Mitigation:** Clear disclaimers; position as "aid" to search, not replacement for human judgment

6. **International Deployment:** How do we handle different LoRa frequencies (US 915MHz vs EU 868MHz vs Asia 923MHz)?
   - **Solution:** Hardware SKUs for each region; firmware auto-detects frequency on boot

### Strategic

7. **Sustainability:** How do we fund ongoing development after initial launch?
   - **Options:** (a) Grants from DHS/FEMA, (b) Hardware sales via contract manufacturing, (c) SaaS command center hosting
   - **Preference:** Open hardware + SaaS model (hardware at cost, command center $50/month subscription for large organizations)

8. **Partnerships:** Which organizations should we partner with for validation and adoption?
   - **Priority 1:** FEMA US&R Task Forces (28 teams nationwide)
   - **Priority 2:** National Association for Search and Rescue (NASAR)
   - **Priority 3:** International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG)
   - **Priority 4:** Medical device manufacturers (Medtronic, Abbott, Dexcom) for MAC prefix database

## Appendix A: Medical Device Detection Modes

### Mode 1: Known MAC Prefix Detection

**How it works:** Node firmware contains hardcoded list of medical device MAC prefixes (OUI database)

**Detection Example:**
```
[Node detects BLE advertisement]
MAC: 70:B3:D5:B3:4:1A:2B
RSSI: -72 dBm

[Firmware checks OUI]
Prefix: 70:B3:D5:B3:4 → MATCH: Medtronic cardiac device

[Immediate priority alert sent via LoRa]
Priority: CRITICAL
Device Type: Pacemaker/ICD
Location: 34.0522°N, 118.2437°W
Est. Distance: 18 meters
```

### Mode 2: BLE Service UUID Analysis

**How it works:** Node logs advertised BLE service UUIDs; command center correlates with medical device database

**Detection Example:**
```
[Node detects BLE advertisement]
MAC: A4:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6 (unknown vendor)
Service UUIDs: [0x180D, 0x180F, Custom:0xFE12]

[Command center lookup]
0x180D → Heart Rate Service (Bluetooth SIG standard)
0x180F → Battery Service
Custom:0xFE12 → Possibly proprietary health device

[Alert generated]
Priority: MEDIUM
Device Type: Wearable health monitor (suspected)
Confidence: 70%
```

### Mode 3: RPA (Resolvable Private Address) Resolution

**How it works:** Pre-registered users provide IRK; node firmware resolves random MAC to true identity

**Detection Example:**
```
[Node detects BLE advertisement]
MAC: 4C:AB:12:34:56:78 (random address, changes every 15 min)

[Firmware attempts IRK resolution using btrpa-scan algorithm]
IRK Database: 50 pre-registered users (opt-in disaster preparedness program)
→ IRK #23 resolves to TRUE IDENTITY: John Doe, iPhone 15 Pro

[Alert generated]
Priority: HIGH (pre-registered user)
Device Type: Smartphone (iPhone)
Owner: John Doe (Age 67, medical conditions: diabetes, hypertension)
Location: 34.0522°N, 118.2437°W
```

## Appendix B: LoRa Mesh Network Design

### Frequency Plans

| Region | Frequency Band | Channels | TX Power Limit |
|--------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| **North America** | 902-928 MHz | 64 channels (125kHz BW) | 30 dBm EIRP |
| **Europe** | 863-870 MHz | 8 channels (125kHz BW) | 14 dBm EIRP (27 dBm with LBT) |
| **Asia (CN)** | 470-510 MHz | 96 channels (125kHz BW) | 19.15 dBm EIRP |
| **Australia** | 915-928 MHz | 64 channels (125kHz BW) | 30 dBm EIRP |

### Mesh Topology Example (20-node deployment)

```
                    [Command Center]
                           |
         +-----------------+-----------------+
         |                 |                 |
    [Node 1]          [Node 2]          [Node 3]
    (Elevated)        (Elevated)        (Elevated)
       / \               / \               / \
      /   \             /   \             /   \
  [N4]   [N5]      [N6]   [N7]      [N8]   [N9]
  (Field) (Field)  (Field) (Field)  (Field) (Field)
    |       |         |       |         |       |
  [N10]  [N11]     [N12]  [N13]     [N14]  [N15]
  (Ground)(Ground) (Ground)(Ground) (Ground)(Ground)
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Hierarchical:** Elevated nodes act as "supernodes" with longer range
- **Redundant:** Multiple paths between any two nodes (self-healing)
- **Dynamic:** Mesh automatically reconfigures if node fails

### Message Routing Example

```
Scenario: Node 10 detects medical device; needs to reach Command Center

Path 1 (Primary): Node 10 → Node 4 → Node 1 → Command Center (3 hops, 8 sec)
Path 2 (Backup):  Node 10 → Node 5 → Node 2 → Command Center (3 hops, 9 sec)
Path 3 (If Node 4 fails): Node 10 → Node 11 → Node 5 → Node 2 → Command Center (4 hops, 12 sec)
```
