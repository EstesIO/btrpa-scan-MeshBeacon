# btrpa-scan: MeshBeacon Search and Rescue Extension

**Extending BLE detection from laptop-based scanning to field-deployable mesh networks for time-critical search operations.**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

This repository extends **[Dave Kennedy's](https://twitter.com/HackingDave) btrpa-scan** Bluetooth detection technology into a distributed mesh network system designed for search and rescue operations.

**Original btrpa-scan (by [@HackingDave](https://github.com/hackingdave)):**
- **Discover All Devices** - Scan for all broadcasting BLE devices in range with signal strength, estimated distance, manufacturer data, and service UUIDs
- **Targeted Search** - Search for a specific device by MAC address and monitor every detection
- **IRK Resolution** - Resolve Resolvable Private Addresses against one or more Identity Resolving Keys to identify devices using randomized addresses for privacy
- **Multiple IRKs** - Load multiple IRKs from a file to resolve addresses for several devices in a single scan
- **RSSI Filtering** - Filter out weak signals with a minimum RSSI threshold
- **RSSI Averaging** - Sliding window average smooths noisy BLE RSSI readings for more stable distance estimates
- **Name Filtering** - Filter devices by name with case-insensitive substring matching
- **Active Scanning** - Send SCAN_REQ to get SCAN_RSP with additional service UUIDs and device names that passive scanning misses
- **Environment Presets** - Indoor, outdoor, and free-space path-loss models for more accurate distance estimation
- **Proximity Alerts** - Audible/visual alert when a device is estimated within a configurable distance
- **Web GUI** - Browser-based radar interface with animated sweep, distance visualization, GPS map, signal-strength device list with pin/unpin, and hover tooltips
- **Live TUI** - Curses-based live-updating table sorted by signal strength
- **Real-Time CSV Log** - Stream each detection to a CSV file as it happens
- **Batch Export** - Export results to CSV, JSON, or JSONL at end of scan (supports stdout with `-o -`)
- **GPS Location Stamping** - Tag each detection with GPS coordinates via gpsd; tracks per-device best location (strongest RSSI = closest proximity). On by default, degrades gracefully if gpsd is unavailable
- **Multi-Adapter** - Scan with multiple Bluetooth adapters simultaneously (Linux)
- **Verbose/Quiet Modes** - Verbose mode shows additional details (e.g. non-matching RPAs in IRK mode); quiet mode suppresses per-device output and shows only the summary
- **Perfect for:** Forensics, proximity detection, device tracking

**MeshBeacon Extension (this fork):**
- LoRa mesh network of low-cost detection nodes ($18-36 each)
- Distributed deployment across disaster zones
- Real-time command center coordination
- **Perfect for:** SAR operations, disaster response, wilderness rescue

> **Credit Where Due:** The core BLE detection algorithms, RPA resolution, and GPS tagging were created by David Kennedy ([@HackingDave](https://twitter.com/HackingDave)) at [TrustedSec](https://www.trustedsec.com). This project builds upon that foundation to address a specific emergency response use case.

## 🚨 The Emergency Response Use Case

**Scenario:** Earthquake collapses apartment building. 50+ residents potentially trapped. Cellular towers down. Time is critical.

**Problem:** Traditional search methods (voice calls, thermal imaging, search dogs) struggle when:
- Victims are unconscious or unable to respond
- Heavy debris blocks sight and sound
- Large search areas overwhelm available personnel
- Infrastructure (cell towers, power) is destroyed

**Solution:** Nearly everyone carries Bluetooth devices:
- **Medical devices** (pacemakers, insulin pumps, CGMs) - always transmitting
- **Smartphones** - constant BLE advertising
- **Wearables** (Apple Watch, Fitbit) - frequent broadcasts
- **Hearing aids, wireless earbuds** - persistent signals

**MeshBeacon detects these signals, coordinates multiple search teams, and provides GPS-tagged detection points to command centers.**

<<<<<<< HEAD
| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Plain hex | `0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF` |
| Colon-separated | `01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF` |
| Dash-separated | `01-23-45-67-89-AB-CD-EF-01-23-45-67-89-AB-CD-EF` |
| 0x-prefixed | `0x0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF` |

#### IRK from a File

Load one or more IRKs from a file. Each line should contain one IRK in any supported hex format. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk-file keys.txt
```

Example `keys.txt`:

```
# Alice's phone
0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
# Bob's watch
FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210
```

When multiple IRKs are loaded, each detected RPA is checked against all keys. The summary shows total matches across all keys.

#### IRK from Environment Variable

Set the `BTRPA_IRK` environment variable to avoid passing the key on the command line:

```bash
export BTRPA_IRK=0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
python3 btrpa-scan.py
```

Priority: `--irk` > `--irk-file` > `BTRPA_IRK`

### RSSI Filtering

Only show devices with signal strength above a threshold:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --min-rssi -70
```

### RSSI Averaging

BLE RSSI is inherently noisy. Use a sliding window average for more stable distance estimates and to filter out spurious weak detections:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --rssi-window 5
```

When windowing is active, the display shows both raw and averaged RSSI (e.g. `RSSI: -65 dBm (avg: -62 dBm over 5 readings)`), and distance estimation uses the averaged value. The `--min-rssi` filter also applies to the averaged RSSI, preventing a single noisy spike from dropping a device.

### Name Filtering

Filter devices by name using a case-insensitive substring match:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --name-filter "AirPods"
```

Only devices whose advertised name contains the given pattern will be shown. Devices with no name are excluded when a name filter is active.

### Active Scanning

Passive scanning (the default) only sees advertisements. Active scanning sends `SCAN_REQ` and gets `SCAN_RSP`, which can reveal additional service UUIDs and device names:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --active
```

> **Note:** On macOS, CoreBluetooth always scans actively regardless of this flag. On Linux/BlueZ, active scanning may require root or `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.

### Environment Presets

Distance estimation uses a path-loss exponent that varies by environment. The default (`free_space`, n=2.0) assumes no obstructions. For more realistic estimates indoors:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --environment indoor
```

| Preset | Path-Loss Exponent (n) | Use Case |
|--------|------------------------|----------|
| `free_space` | 2.0 | Open air, line of sight |
| `outdoor` | 2.2 | Parks, parking lots |
| `indoor` | 3.0 | Offices, homes, buildings |

Higher `n` values produce larger distance estimates for the same RSSI, reflecting signal attenuation from walls and obstacles.

### Reference RSSI Calibration

By default btrpa-scan derives the expected RSSI at 1 metre from the advertised TX Power using an empirically validated 59 dB offset (the iBeacon standard). For even better accuracy you can supply a calibrated value measured in your own environment:

1. Place the target device exactly 1 metre from the scanner.
2. Run a short scan and note the average RSSI.
3. Pass that value with `--ref-rssi`:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --ref-rssi -55
```

When `--ref-rssi` is set, TX Power is ignored entirely. This also enables distance estimates for devices that don't advertise TX Power.

### Proximity Alerts

Trigger an audible bell and visual alert when a device is estimated within a given distance. Requires that the target device advertise TX Power:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --alert-within 5.0
```

Works in all modes including IRK resolution:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk <key> --alert-within 3.0
```

### Live TUI

Replace scrolling output with a live-updating terminal table, sorted by signal strength:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --tui
```

The TUI shows all detected devices in a compact table with address, name, RSSI, averaged RSSI, estimated distance, detection count, and last-seen time. Resolved IRK matches are shown in bold, and devices within the `--alert-within` threshold are highlighted.

Combine with other flags:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk <key> --tui --rssi-window 5 --environment indoor --alert-within 5.0
```

### Web GUI

Launch a browser-based radar interface with an animated sweep, real-time device tracking, and GPS map:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --gui
```

The GUI features:

- **Radar display** — animated sweep line with concentric distance rings (1m, 5m, 10m, 20m). Devices appear as color-coded dots positioned by estimated distance (green = close, yellow = medium, red = far). Full-height layout with matrix data rain background and ghost MAC flicker effects
- **Device list** — right-side panel listing all detected devices, color-coded by signal strength. Click any device to pin it for tracking
- **Pinned devices** — left-side panel showing pinned MAC addresses with live RSSI and distance updates. Pin multiple devices simultaneously; click × to unpin
- **GPS map** — Leaflet.js map with OpenStreetMap tiles showing scanner position and device locations. Automatically hidden if no GPS is available
- **Hover tooltips** — hover over any device (radar dot, list entry, or pinned entry) to see full device details (address, name, RSSI, TX power, distance, GPS, manufacturer data, services)
- **Dark theme** — matrix-green hacker aesthetic designed for field work

GUI mode scans continuously by default (no 30-second timeout). Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. Use `-t` to set a specific scan duration:

```bash
# Scan for 60 seconds with indoor path-loss model
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --gui -t 60 --environment indoor

# Custom port
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --gui --gui-port 8080

# Combine with RSSI averaging and proximity alerts
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --gui --rssi-window 5 --alert-within 5.0
```

> **Note:** `--gui` requires Flask and flask-socketio (`pip install flask flask-socketio`). Cannot be combined with `--tui` or `--quiet`.

### Real-Time CSV Log

Stream each detection to a CSV file as it happens (useful for long-running scans where you want incremental data):

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --log scan.csv
```

This can be combined with `--output` for a separate batch export:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --log live.csv --output json -o results.json
```

### Batch Export

Export all results at end of scan in CSV, JSON, or JSONL (JSON Lines) format:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output json -o results.json -t 30
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output csv -t 30
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output jsonl -o results.jsonl -t 30
```

JSONL writes one JSON object per line, making it easy to pipe through `jq`:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output jsonl -o results.jsonl -t 10
cat results.jsonl | jq .
```

Write output to stdout for piping:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output json -o - -t 10 -q | jq .
```

### Multi-Adapter Scanning (Linux)

Scan with multiple Bluetooth adapters simultaneously for wider coverage:

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --adapters hci0,hci1
```

Each adapter runs its own scanner instance sharing the same detection callback. All detections are merged into a single output.

### GPS Location Stamping

GPS is **on by default**. Each detection is tagged with the current GPS coordinates from gpsd. The scanner also tracks the **best GPS fix per device** — the coordinates from the detection with the strongest RSSI (closest proximity = most accurate location).

If gpsd is not running, the scanner prints a note and continues normally without GPS:

```bash
# With gpsd running — detections include lat/lon
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --output json

# Without gpsd — works fine, GPS fields are empty
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all

# Explicitly disable GPS (skips connection attempt)
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all --no-gps
```

GPS coordinates appear in:
- **Console output** — "Best GPS" line per device
- **TUI settings bar** — current fix coordinates
- **GUI** — interactive map panel with device markers and scanner position
- **Header** — GPS connection status
- **Summary tables** — "Best GPS" column per device
- **All exports** (CSV, JSON, JSONL, real-time log) — `latitude`, `longitude`, `gps_altitude` fields

### Quiet and Verbose Modes

Run in quiet mode (summary only, no per-device output — useful with `--output` or `--log`):

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --all -q --output json -t 30
```

Run in verbose mode (show non-matching RPAs in IRK mode):

```bash
python3 btrpa-scan.py --irk 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF -v
```

## How RPA Resolution Works

Bluetooth Low Energy devices use Resolvable Private Addresses (RPAs) to prevent tracking. An RPA is a temporary MAC address that changes periodically, but can be resolved by anyone who possesses the device's Identity Resolving Key (IRK).

An RPA consists of:
- **prand** (3 bytes) - A random value with the top two bits set to `01`
- **hash** (3 bytes) - Computed as `AES-128-ECB(IRK, padding || prand)` truncated to 3 bytes

btrpa-scan implements the `ah()` function from the Bluetooth Core Specification (Vol 3, Part H, Section 2.2.2) to resolve these addresses in real time.

> **Note on AES-ECB:** The use of AES in ECB mode for the `ah()` function is mandated by the Bluetooth Core Specification. Because only a single 16-byte block is ever encrypted, ECB's lack of diffusion across blocks is irrelevant — this is not a vulnerability.

## Security Considerations

- **IRK on the command line:** Command-line arguments are visible to other users on the system via `ps`. To avoid exposing the IRK, use `--irk-file` to read from a file, or set the `BTRPA_IRK` environment variable. Console output masks IRKs by default (showing only the first and last 4 hex characters).
- **GPS coordinates in exports:** All export formats (CSV, JSON, JSONL) and console output include GPS coordinates when available. If sharing scan results, be aware that your location may be disclosed. Use `--no-gps` to disable GPS entirely.
- **Output file paths:** The `--output-file` and `--log` options write to the specified path. Ensure the destination has appropriate permissions for your use case.
